# Sales Report MM 10AUG2019


The sales department throughout quarter three this year has invested heavily in preparation for October, creating over a thousand Bawdy Bags in June. With preparation in such bulk we were able to lower the cost of resources even further than previous builds and in the case of noisemakers provide a slightly better product in our bawdy bags. Clay Bags cost us $0.71 per unit to produce and Guild bags cost us $0.79 per unit to produce with a majority of bags being sold for $2.50 each that is a profit of $1.79 and $1.71 respectively. Looking into Q4 projections we are looking to sell around 1500 total with the Reno show and four clay shows in October looking to having the highest sales, if that goal is reached it will bring us $3,750 (approx. $2,500 of that being profit) from the Bawdy Bags alone.

 During this quarter a Sales meeting was held and it was decided that we are looking to heavily expand our current merch offerings into Patches, Pins and Temporary tattoos, and all are currently in the works and expected to be available for sale before October.  
 
On the t-shirt end of things there have been low sales on a show to show basis throughout this quarter, but is expected to drastically improve during October, especially on our road shows (Reno in particular) and $500 for extra t-shirts was approved in preparation. As it stands right now we are making around $8 on every t-shirt sale, The goal we would like to set for Sales of t-shirts this October is 60, which would give us $900 ($480 of profit)  

This last Quarter we have seen a handful of new faces helping run the sales table and we are looking to help all of the new sales members be able to feel confident doing every task and feel be able to make sure there is solid consistent operation regardless of specific attendance.

Going into this busy next quarter Sales is looking to expand upon marketing our merchandise on social media to get our audience thinking about purchasing merchandise before they come to the show. We are also currently in the process of improving the visual appearance of our sales set-up to better engage the potential customers. It was decided at the meeting that we were looking to improve the rewards card system, to include a better, more progressive system with better, more personal reawrds. But looking at the current timeline, that is going to be something that is being moved to start us off Next year rather then before October, with more input and based on merchandise that has not yet been added to the table (specifically patches and pins) 

Coming in this next quarter we are looking to design 25th anniversary merchandise to be able to have ready going into next year, other than that letâ€™s just be looking to maintain the readiness additude going into the madness, and be ready to help give our audience what they expect and more, thank you everyone who has contributed to improvements of the department.
