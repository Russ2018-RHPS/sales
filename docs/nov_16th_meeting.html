<h2>Sales Department November 2019 Report</h2>

<p>Well, we got through the busy season, our hard work paid off, we sold shit we made <font color=”green”> <b> money. </b></font> The Enamel pins have been selling (although we still have a considerable amount of inventory). Speaking of <a href="allin.html" target="_blank">inventory</a> We have sold most of our Bawdy Bags and are looking to make more very soon (pending budget approval). That budget proposal is <a href="2020/budget.html" target="_blank">available here</a> and was discussed at a meeting the department had <a href="nov_1st_meeting.html" target="_blank">November 1st </a> Where we also laid down a loose plan for new hoodies <b>Lisa</b> is in charge of that. We are looking to design 25th Anniversary Enamel Pins <b>(updates to come in <img src="https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2019/11/12/f3f70dbb42ad520da96b5d81c6a32ea9-full.png"/ height="20px"> soon).</b> We discussed making more project deadlines to encourage participation and maximize efficiency. <br><br>I would like to welcome new member <b>Alex</b> I  have only worked with them once but they seem to have great enthusiasm and will be a great addition to the team. To all of the other members I've seen grow their skills this year Russell, Thia and Sonja I really appreciate your willfulness to make sales improve. And to everyone else who has been doing this shit for <b> Forever</b> thanks for putting up with my attitude in this first (almost full) year of my department heading.  <br><br> Looking back at the last sales report from before the last meeting I would like to touch on the point we did not make all of our goals. Throughout the whole season we only sold 20 t-shirts (our goal was 60) Many of the table improvements didn't get worked on at all, and We only sold 886 Bawdy Bags (our goal was 1500) <b>*we only cancelled 3 shows in that timeframe* </b> So going forward goals should be more realistic or we really need to expand on making those goals a reality, Which means more marketing and more shows :-). <br><br> With that in mind The goals I have for this quarter is to fulfill the table improvement goals (add stuff to the table to make it look cooler). Get a real considerable start on changing the fucking Rewards card system to digital. Get the 25th anniversary pins designed and ordered for the New Years Eve show and most importantly more effort on encouraging  members to feel confident at doing different things/ participating  inside and outside shows. <b>Well, that’s about all I got, Until next quarter, Give yourself over to absolute pleasure, Don't dream it be it! and take in those old Steve Reaves movies \m/.</b>
